//Guess it #8 - Revampt
// GitHub Challenge
// What separates the work I done today on this program from when I originally created this program, is the following;
// I kept the game at only 10 digits to guess still, but now I'm able to break out the player from continuus tries, 
// after only 3 tries, if that is what I choose to set my parameter as. When before the player could keep on guessing until he landed on the number the randomizer had chosen.
// its a working progress but I've made this change, thus giving me more control over my program and also added the validation.


// so this is Mark A Ramirez first off the guess it dosnt follow the orginal guide lines you need a difficulty setting second the restart function dosent work if i type in yes it asks me if i wan't to play again and even if i win it tell me i win then tells me I lose
